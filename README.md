## NBA News Bot
A bot designed to keep your server updated with the latest NBA news! 

## General
This bot scans tweets from [Adrian Wojnarowski's](https://twitter.com/wojespn) twitter feed and posts them into your discord server. The bot will filter out any unrelated tweets and advertisements to keep your server spam free. 

## Setup
To begin receiving tweets, all you need to do is invite the bot to your server. It will automatically set itself up in the first text channel on your server. Any new tweets will be posted in that channel. To change the channel that the tweets are posted in, use the **"setchannel"** command listed in the section below.
